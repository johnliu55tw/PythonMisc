    Args:
        buffer (bytes): The data.
        header (bytes): The header of the packet.
        length (int): The length of the packet.
            User could pass this argument to define the packet length if
            it's consistent for all the packet. If the length of the packet
            is inconsistent and defined by the data packet itself (through
            some certain field in the packet), user could defines it by 
            the lengthIndex argument. Notice that either length or 
            lengthIndex must be passed. If both were passed, the length
            will override the lengthIndex.
        lengthIndex (int): The index of the length information in the packet.
            User could pass this argument to define the packet length if 
            the length information is self-contained by the packet.
        lengthOffset (int): The offset which will be added to the packet length.
            Sometimes the length information provided by the packet itself
            will be different from the real packet length. For instance, the
            length information may not include the header and checksum.
            Since this function requires total length to be working, user
            could use this argument to increase the length information 
            provided by the packet inself. Notice this won't work when the
            length information is provided by the length argument.
        ChksumIncludeHeader (bool): Define if the header is included in 
            checksum calculation.
            Sometimes the calculation of checksum excludes the header. User
            could use this argument to defined this.

    Returns:
        checkedPacketList (list of bytes): Valid packet list.
        remainedPacket (bytes): remained data byte
